## Henry Hobhouse

I am a lesser known blend of [operations (<-oxymorinic right?->) creative] mixed with stratedgy. I love learning, I am obessive over the details. I enjoy problem solving. I have a habit of creating said problems through life challenges. Within Technology these include founding two ecommerce businesses. One sold to a FTSE 250 company. Outside of technology these include competing in IronMan triathalons and building my own house.

I am currently a data analyst, project manager, problem solver, communicator, team player >> Product Manager. I became this through being a successful ecommerce entrepreneur, failed ecommerce entrepreneur, technolgy consultant.

I am studying in the April '17 cohort of the venerable Makers Academy coding bootcamp. I will be a junior full stack developer in 3 months time. I will be an even better Product Manager and looking for a role in a team making awesome products. This is my challenge.

## Skills >> Solving Problems >> Building Web Apps

Test, Learn, Action. Repeat. Its that simply. I utilise quite a few web analytical tools, A/B test methodogly, fast agile iternations, interaction with customers and do so by selling all principles to the relevant team via collabrative agreement.

#### Example 1 - ShortersClub.co.uk
- Co-founded in 2010.
- Product managed the first online bulk food grocers in the UK.
- Learned how to develop digital products through their full life-cycle.
- First introduced to Lean methodology.
- Successfully sold the business in Oct 2011 to Booker PLC
- Project managed, working with Bookers digital and operations teams, developing a new internal web app to manage operations within all delivery centres. This was roll-out to work within their existing Â£900m digital commerce channel.

#### Example 2 - Dropwines.com
- Co-founded in 2012
- Managed pivot of principle product proposition from daily deals to flash sales causing uptake in early cohort activation by ~70.6% and increased total revenue per member by ~57.7%
- Developed a landing page strategy using dynamic content, built using marketing keywords from paid marketing channels (Twitter, FB and Adwords). Improved CPA, to email marketing list, by ~32.3% and CPA to paid member by 23.2%.
- Planned, and was project managing, pivoting the supply chain from a marketplace to a centralised distribution model to improve operating margin by a projected 120.3% over a 5 month project window.
