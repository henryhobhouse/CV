## Henry Hobhouse

I am a lesser known blend of [logic (<-oxymorinic right?->) creative] mixed with stratedgy. I love learning, I am obessive over the details. I enjoy problem solving. I have a habit of creating said problems through life challenges. Within Technology these include founding two ecommerce businesses. One sold to a FTSE 250 company. Outside of technology these include competing in IronMan triathalons and building my own house.

I am currently a data analyst, project manager, problem solver, communicator, team player >> Product Manager. I became this through being a successful ecommerce entrepreneur, failed ecommerce entrepreneur, technolgy consultant.

I studyied in the April '17 cohort of the venerable Makers Academy coding bootcamp. I now have the raw skill-set of a junior full stack developer and plan to persue building on this.
