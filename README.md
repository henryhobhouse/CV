# Henry Hobhouse

I am a lesser known blend of [logic (<-oxymoronic right?->) creative] mixed with strategy. I love learning, I am obsessive over the
details. I enjoy problem solving. I have a habit of creating said problems through life challenges. Within Technology these include
founding two ecommerce businesses. One sold to a FTSE 250 company. Outside of technology these include competing in IronMan triathlons
and building my own house.

I am currently a junior full-stack developer using my skills in data analysis, problem solving, communication and
ability to work in a team. I acquired these skills through being a successful ecommerce entrepreneur, failed ecommerce
entrepreneur, technology consultant and Makers Academy alumnus.

**Tech Skills** : JavaScript >> TypeScript, Node.js, Angular, jQuery, MySQL, Docker, Webpack, Babel, HTML5, CSS3, AWS S3
