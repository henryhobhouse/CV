# Henry Hobhouse

I am a lesser known blend of [logic (<-oxymoronic right?->) creative] mixed with strategy. I love learning, I am obsessive over the
details. I enjoy problem solving. I have a habit of creating said problems through life challenges. Within technology these include
founding two ecommerce businesses. One sold to a FTSE 250 company. Outside of technology these include competing in IronMan triathlons
and building my own house.

I am currently a senior frontend engineer / product lead using my skills in data analysis, problem solving, communication and
ability to work in a team. I acquired these skills through being a successful ecommerce entrepreneur, failed ecommerce
entrepreneur, enjoying my work in interesting tech startups and Makers Academy alumnus.

**Tech Skills** : JavaScript >> TypeScript, Node.js, React, graphql/apollo, nextjs, Webpack, Babel, HTML5, CSS3, Styled Components and/or Emotion JS

## Skills

#### Solving Problems >> Building Web Apps
Test, Learn, Action. Repeat. Utilising quite a feedback tools/methodologies such as TDD, Pull requests, QA testing, fast agile
iterations, interaction with stakeholders/PMs and do so by selling all principles to my direct team via collaborative agreement.

#### Team driving force
I have the ability to find what is exciting about a project, and bring this enthusiasm to a whole team. I also have the
perseverance to get things done and to keep going with a problem until it is solved. This approach, along with my soft skills from historic product roles, has enabled me to go from a junior engineer to senior and also take on the role of a product lead in one of the two product teams.

* Built, independently, a new formatting library to allow for programmatic localisation for all currencies, dates, numbers and percentages.
