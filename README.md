# Henry Hobhouse

I am a lesser known blend of [logic (<-oxymorinic right?->) creative] mixed with stratedgy. I love learning, I am obessive over the details. I enjoy problem solving. I have a habit of creating said problems through life challenges. Within Technology these include founding two ecommerce businesses. One sold to a FTSE 250 company. Outside of technology these include competing in IronMan triathalons and building my own house.

I am currently a junior full-stack developer and project manager using my skills in data analysis, problem solving, communication and ability to work in, and help focus, a team. I aquired these skills through being a successful ecommerce entrepreneur, failed ecommerce entrepreneur, technology consultant and Makers Academy alumna.
